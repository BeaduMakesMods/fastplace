# FastPlace
Makes doing Dream's boat clutch much easier!

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

USE ONLY WITH Fabric API!!

This mod uses mixins to change the item use delay to 0, letting you place blocks fast, thus making it a "FastPlace" mod.

I (Beadu) AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACTIONS, (good or bad), WHICH THIS MOD WILL BE USED FOR. I UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE, (as people are), WILL USE THIS FOR BAD INTENTIONS, BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT OTHER PEOPLE WILL USE IT FOR GOOD, AND WILL NOT HAVE TO USE HACKED CLIENTS INSTEAD.

To-Do List:

1. Add a toggle.
2. Add more features (hopefully).

I MADE THIS MOD TO IMPRESS MY FRIENDS, AS NOW I CAN DO A BOAT CLUTCH. PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS FOR ANYTHING ELSE!
